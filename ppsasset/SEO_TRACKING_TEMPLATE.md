ORGANIC SEARCH ROI ANALYSIS - Year 1

INVESTMENT:
- Tool subscriptions: $0 (using free tools)
- Content creation time: 100 hours @ $50/hr = $5,000
- Technical optimization: 20 hours @ $75/hr = $1,500
- Total Investment: $6,500

RESULTS (Year 1):
- Total Organic Leads: 600
- Average Lead Value: $300 (avg project interest)
- Revenue Generated: 600 × $300 = $180,000
- Cost Per Lead: $6,500 / 600 = $10.83 (EXTREMELY LOW)

ROI:
- Gross ROI: ($180,000 - $6,500) / $6,500 = 2,662%
- Monthly Revenue: $15,000 from organic search alone

COMPARISON:
- Paid Ads: Cost $5-10 per click, 2% conversion = $250-500 per lead
- Organic Search: Cost $11 per lead (spreads across year)
- ORGANIC IS 20-50X CHEAPER!

Year 2+:

## Most Important Metrics (Watch These!)

### If you can only track 5 things:
1. **Impressions in Search Console** (Are people searching for you?)
2. **Clicks in Search Console** (Are people clicking your link?)
3. **Organic Sessions in Analytics** (Is traffic growing?)
4. **Conversion Rate** (Are visitors becoming leads?)
5. **Average Ranking Position** (Are you moving up in rankings?)

---

## Red Flags (Act Immediately!)

- Impressions suddenly drop → Check for Google penalty
- Indexed pages decrease → Check robots.txt, check if pages deleted
- Zero organic traffic → Check if GA4 tracking code installed
- Conversion rate < 1% → Content not matching keywords
- Core Web Vitals failing → Fix technical issues ASAP

---

**Remember: You don't improve what you don't measure!**

Check this dashboard weekly for the first month, then monthly after that.
